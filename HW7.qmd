## HW 7: MLE and Frequentist Behavior

#Question 1:A,ii

Plotting the likelihood of the data for theta from 0 to 1.

```{r}
# Define the likelihood function / pmf for a Bernoulli
likelihood <- function(theta, n, x) {
  return(theta^x * (1 - theta)^(n - x))
}

# Parameters from question
n <- 32  # Total number of people
x <- 8   # Number of survivors

# 100 Theta values from 0 to 1
theta <- seq(0, 1, length.out = 100)

# Calculate likelihood for each theta
likelihood_values <- likelihood(theta, n, x)


# Plot the likelihood
plot(theta, likelihood_values, type = "l", col = "blue", lwd = 2,
     xlab = expression(theta), ylab = "Likelihood",
     main = "Likelihood of Theta (0, 1)")+
  grid()


```


#Question 1:B,i

```{r}

#same parameters as above, just logging the values and re-plotting
loglike <- log10(likelihood_values)

# Plot the likelihood
plot(theta, loglike, type = "l", col = "blue", lwd = 2,
     xlab = expression(theta), ylab = "Log-Likelihood",
     main = "Log-Likelihood of Theta (0, 1)")+
  grid()


```
