# HW 11: Linear Models

```{r}

# Load data
crp <- read.csv("crp.csv")

# Design matrix including interaction term
X <- model.matrix(CRP ~ Age + Gender + Age*Gender, data = crp)

# Response vector
y <- crp$CRP

# Cross-product of the design matrix
cross <- t(X) %*% X

# Cross-product of design matrix and  y
cross_y <- t(X) %*% y

# Solve for  coefficients using Normal Equations
beta <- solve(cross) %*% cross_y
print(beta)

#standard lm method
fit <- lm(CRP ~ Age + Gender + Age*Gender, data = crp)
summary(fit)
