## Homework 9 - Multiple Testing

# Question 1: Differential Gene Expression

a. 
```{r}
#read in the HW file
pmix <- scan(file = "pmix.txt")

#histogram of data displayed as proportions
pmix.hist <- hist(pmix)
pmix.hist$density <- pmix.hist$counts / sum(pmix.hist$counts)
plot(pmix.hist, freq = F)

```

There is a peak on the far left side, so this is a sign there is signal in the data. This resembles more of a exponential distribution 

b.
```{r}

plot(ppoints(pmix))




```
